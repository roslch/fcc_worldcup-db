# World Cup Database (freeCodeCamp)

This is one of the projects required to obtain the “Relational Database” certification. For this project, a database of world cup matches and national teams was built using PostgreSQL.

The data used for the exercise is contained in the file **games.csv**.

The insertion of data into the tables was done using the executable script **insert_data.sh**. 

Additionally, the executable file **queries.sh** contains a series of SQL queries to answer specific questions of the exercise.
